## Accounting of Reagents

Accounting for chemical reagents—it sounds grandiose and dull. It's that aspect of laboratory life which most people regard as a necessary evil. Yet, there's no avoiding it. More than once, after setting up the lab, I've found something essential missing. It's particularly frustrating when your developer is almost ready, and there's no fixer. This is exactly how I once ran out of sodium thiosulphate (105). That day I told myself, "Enough," and started a logbook. It worked. Firstly, I now knew precisely what I lacked. Secondly, restocking became simpler, especially when buying collectively or on a budget. Justifying expenses became straightforward and evident—nothing even needed writing. One glance, and everyone knew what had been used, what remained, and what needed ordering.

This might sound like a motto, but I believe: Accounting, just like architecture, must be useful, reliable—and beautiful. Otherwise, it collapses or is forgotten. Truth isn't proven; it's shown. Without beauty, there is no meaning. Thus, I will tell you an almost fictitious story about accounting and storage. This narrative will be more useful than ten manuals.

...It took place in a school somewhere between Weimar and Dessau, in the 1930s. Names are intentional; any coincidences impossible, yet plausible. Such a school could have existed if time hadn't rushed so ruthlessly. Everything else is author's imagination and pure typography.

Over several years, paper-filled shelves gradually squeezed out chemical cabinets, refusing to retreat. More than 150 items, wrapped in parchment, metal and glass, crowded precariously on glass shelves, risking loss of activity, seemingly beyond salvation.

Herbert, the project coordinator, thumbed through laboratory journals. Herbert, formerly a typographer, understood typefaces faster than words. He read the journal not as text but as a stage: lines breathed, numbers argued, fonts spoke. Forty-nine doses of Silver Bromide—Gloria's note, compressed into nonpareil—echoed regular lab-goer László's voice: "Patience exhausted." Lucia, lab assistant and packing master, counterpointed briskly: (Didot. Mignon) "Your absurdity perfected." A student declared, "A table in pearl type is beyond me; I disappear." Petit grotesque shouted angrily: "Enough!" Hmm. Right alignment was resistance. Someone had written in Mignon, running off the page as if unable to fit the format, crying: "We're trapped within these frames!" This was no journal. It was a visual manifesto—chaos, meticulously ordered by fonts. Entirely in the school's spirit.

Soon, Herbert replaced cumbersome bureaucracy with a neat table, transforming it into something musical—"akin to Hindemith's compositions, each playing its part without interfering with others." Herbert set the rhythm, observing the bigger picture, deciding when and what to order. His pencil notes in the 'Procurement' column were sparse yet precise, always in universal typeface: "350g" and surrounding empty space. Impossible to overlook! The letter "A" denoted inviolable archival stock for sensitive reagents with low consumption but high volume. Three exclamation marks indicated urgent procurement. Need one mention Lucia meticulously marked the archival cabinet and every container?

No pictograms, emojis, or smileys. "'!!!' ist kein bloßes Warnsignal—es ist der visuelle Dissonanz-Akkord," ("'!!!' is not merely a warning signal; it is a visual dissonance chord") was Herbert's final verdict, assigning Lucia sole responsibility to place this "warning signal." After receipt and logging of reagents, only Herbert himself could erase it.

Lucia, the lab master, worked with jeweller's precision. She methodically filled shelves with creations as precise as table entries: "4×0.4" indicated four sealed doses of 0.4 grams each. Date of packing was mandatory. Sartorius Werke scales, locked in a glass cabinet, were her tool: exacting, demanding, uncompromising. They forgave neither wind nor shadow—just like Lucia herself. She valued silence, never tolerated inaccuracies—neither in developers nor truth. She respected form no less than light. When scales weren't in her hands, it was a Voigtländer camera. Same precision. Same directness. Her photographs weren't memories, but structures: light, line, order.

Once the unsightly shelves disappeared, Lucia handed Herbert photographs of the lab—seemingly random, yet meticulously composed: light, line... emptiness. For her, space was always a composition. Order was disrupted in these images—"Ordnung war gestört" (Something was wrong). Herbert, the former typographer, redesigned the layout into a diagonal modular grid. Cabinet with doses, water tap, and glassware showcase—"cabinet number three"—fell onto its apexes like beats in a rhythm. The emptiness between wasn't a background: it guided the gaze, held pauses. Archival cabinet—to the dark, cool corner. Coat rack—near the entrance. First aid—closer to water. Light became an instrument. Shadow—a boundary. Space—structure. Everything in its place.

László, like other lab regulars, played his part. Tension was history; the simple system ran faultlessly. No spreadsheets, software, or complex algorithms—just pencil, paper, and three roles in the endless play of scientific inquiry. Everyone knew exactly what to write, with the same precision they measured reagents. The lab developed its own hierarchy of substances. Metol, hydroquinone, and other delicate reagents received almost religious reverence—every tenth of a gram mattered. A hydroquinone entry might resemble a small poem:

_4×0.4_  
_5×0.3_  
_30% 20_  
_0.15 5_

This signified nine sealed doses of two types, 20 ml of a 30% solution, and another 5 ml solution at 0.15, possibly oversaturated. Thus, anyone—not just Herbert—could instantly gauge the stock.

Ethanol or distilled water required less ceremony. Nobody counted ethanol drops—pointless as grains of sand on a beach. A tilde marked approximate volumes: "~50ml" or "~100ml 1%".

Indeed, the system resembled a language—with grammar and syntax. Concise symbols instead of bulky sentences. One table instead of lengthy reports. And anyone working there for more than a week spoke this language fluently. Storage conditions were written directly on bottles: C0, M1, T2. Hearing of this innovation, Lucia switched suddenly to Yiddish: "Ikh gleyb nisht in velt-piktogramen. Ober ikh troi tsifern vos zenen sheyn geshribn." (I don't believe in global pictograms. But I trust numbers that are beautifully written.) Her quiet Yiddish needed no clarification. In those years, it was already a choice.

If these designations looked like code to the uninitiated, they clearly indicated storage requirements, sensitivity to moisture and light for lab workers and regulars. No one thought to duplicate this information in the table—it was right before your eyes when needed, on the container itself.

"Eine gute Tabelle ist wie ein gutes Alphabet: leise, aber deutlich. Eine Zeile – ein Gedanke." ("A good table is like a good alphabet: quiet, but clear. One line—one thought,") said Herbert.

Walter looked at the table hanging where shelves once stood. It didn't shout. Didn't explain itself. Simply existed. Strange—he hadn't noticed it immediately. But now couldn't unsee it.
"Beweisen Sie die Logik — und wir integrieren es." ("Prove the logic—and we'll implement it.")

Herbert, usually laconic, patiently explained:
"In 'Procurement'—quarterly receipts. In 'Stock'—current inventory. In 'Dosage'—operational access."
Quarterly reporting ceased being an art.
"Organisation ist der erste Schritt zur freien Gestaltung." (Organization is the first step to free design.)

Walter nodded. Wordlessly. If you don't notice something—it's in its rightful place.

László. In an apron. He glowed.
"Emulsion," he said. "On fabric. I've been exposing myself for a week. Through windows. Through lamps. Through hands.  
I've become photographic paper."

"Forty-nine doses, 98 grams. Almost a hundred, but not quite. Bromide. Seven by seven. I measured them," said Lucia.  
"A beautiful number."  
"Beautiful, like the fullness of suffering."

"Today I need nine developers."  
"Nine is a fracture. Eight would suffice for your area."  
"This is *Licht-Raum-Modulation*," said László, smoothing his apron. "But wearable. A mobile structure of light and time. Body-sized. It needs slightly more than sufficient."

"Take an open one. We can have one dose open. Just one. Open. Forever.  
You want to develop chaos within yourself. But remember—development follows a recipe."  
"Numbers mean nothing. What if I am the recipe?"  
"Then don't forget: talent needs fixer."
