REVERSAL PROCESS — Overview and Methods

1. General Overview of Reversal Processing
   - Purpose and principles of converting negatives into positives for final use or presentation.

1.1 Analog Reversal Methods
   - Traditional darkroom printing on photographic paper
   - Use of dedicated reversal films (slide films, direct positives)

1.2 Digital Reversal Techniques
   - Luma-based inversion in editors (manual curve flipping)
   - Dedicated software for negative scanning and conversion
   - ICC/LUT-based workflows (as used in ON1, Capture One, etc.)

1.3 Common Challenges
   - Color mask in color negative films (orange cast)
   - Non-neutral film base in B&W films (e.g., blue or green tint)
   - Handling density range and crossover issues

1.4 Reshooting Techniques (Backlit Copying)
   - Dealing with uneven illumination
   - Lens flare and internal reflections
   - Film flatness and focus alignment
