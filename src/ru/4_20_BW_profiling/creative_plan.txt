CONCEPT: Building an ICC Profile for Digitized Black-and-White Film

This module will cover the end-to-end process of creating a custom ICC profile for converting scanned (digitized) B&W negatives to accurate positives, using ArgyllCMS tools and a patch-based profiling workflow.

Steps to be documented in the final version:

1. Patch Generation
   - Generate evenly distributed grayscale or color patches with good optical legibility.
   - Tools: `targen` with grayscale (`-d2 -l`) or color (`-d3 -e8`) mode.

2. Pattern Rendering and Printing
   - Render patches using `printtarg`, print onto photographic paper (baryta for B&W).
   - Ensure consistent light and disable printer color corrections.

3. Shooting the Printed Patches onto Film
   - Backlight the print with one of 3 light sources (warm / neutral / cool).
   - Re-photograph using a macro lens and full-frame sensor.
   - Ensure parallelism and uniform illumination.

4. Film Development and Negative Re-Scanning
   - Develop using a consistent process (e.g. D-76, Microphen).
   - Scan negatives (one shot per light type) to obtain `.tif` files.

5. Measurement Extraction
   - Use `scanin` to extract `.ti3` measurement data from each scanned TIFF.

6. Merge Multiple Measurement Sets
   - Combine all `.ti3` files into one (`combo.ti3`) manually or via script.
   - Retain a single `BEGIN_DATA_FORMAT ... END_DATA_FORMAT` section and concatenate the rest.

7. ICC Profile Generation
   - Use `colprof` to generate the ICC profile (`neg2pos.icc`) from merged data.

8. Applying the ICC Profile
   - Install the ICC in your system profile directory.
   - In Capture One or other editors:
     - Assign the custom profile
     - Use a linear tone curve
     - Disable automatic color adjustments

Updating for New Light Sources:
   - Reshoot patches under the new light source.
   - Extract new `.ti3`, append to `combo.ti3`, and regenerate ICC.

Output Files (essential for the process):
- `color_patch.ti1` – original patch layout
- `color_patch.cht/cie` – chart geometry and reference values
- `*.tif` – digitized film scans
- `*.ti3` – extracted measurements
- `combo.ti3` – merged dataset
- `neg2pos.icc` – final working ICC profile
