CONCEPT: ICC Profiling for Color Negative Film

This module will be based on the finalized workflow from `4_20_BW_profiling`, with adaptations for color film.

The overall concept is to expose approximately 1,000 color patches onto color negative film and use them 
to create a custom camera profile for the color reversal process. This allows accurate ICC-based conversion 
of scanned color negatives into linear positives with preserved hue and tonal balance.

Further details will be added once the B&W profiling workflow is fully formalized and validated.
