# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: ANALOG PHOTOGRAPHY PROCESSES


The first chapter presents a framework for home darkroom organization based on the "fresh solutions" principle, which ensures predictable results without storage issues. It introduces a logical coding system for developers with prefixes "F-", "HQ-", and "PQ-" reflecting their chemical composition, while preserving historical names for classic formulations. Phenidone is positioned as a safe and economical alternative to metol, requiring significantly lower concentrations (0.1-1 g/L vs 5-7.5 g/L) and not causing allergies. The chapter traces the evolution of developing agents from pyrogallol through hydroquinone and metol to modern phenidone systems, emphasizing each substance's unique contribution to negative character. For home laboratories, safety, ease of use, and result stability are prioritized, where phenidone+hydroquinone combinations create developers with individual "handwriting" for various photographic tasks. Modern analog photography is described as a hybrid process of chemical negative development followed by digital conversion and editing, providing greater flexibility with fewer resources. Against the backdrop of automated digital photography, the chapter celebrates a conscious approach to each frame, where the development process becomes a creative dialogue between light, silver, and artistic intent.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: HOME LABORATORY ORGANIZATION

The second chapter presents an efficient framework for home darkroom organization based on the "three-box principle": an operational box for regularly used chemicals, an archival box for long-term storage, and a third container for laboratory equipment. Safety protocols emphasize wearing gloves, avoiding powder inhalation, and maintaining focused attention when working with reagents, with water highlighted as the essential first response for chemical exposure. The chapter introduces a logical chemical coding system with three-digit numerical codes plus storage condition indicators (C, T, or M), while stressing proper labeling of all containers. Environmental responsibility is addressed through guidance on chemical waste disposal, noting that while some substances can safely enter sewage systems, most photographic chemicals require specialized disposal. A practical reagent accounting system is presented as essential for maintaining adequate supplies, illustrated through an anecdote about transforming chaotic laboratory records into an elegant tracking system. These organizational principles combine minimalism, sufficiency and convenience, positioning laboratory organization as the foundation for efficient and safe photographic work.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: REAGENT STORAGE AND HANDLING

The third chapter focuses on the proper storage and handling of photochemical reagents, establishing a comprehensive system for maximizing their longevity and effectiveness. At its core is a capsule storage system utilizing inert gas (CO₂) with integrity indicators, which, despite sounding complex, is implemented through practical methods like using amber glass vials with tightly sealing caps and silica gel desiccants. The chapter provides detailed inventory management guidelines, including amber glass vials in various sizes (from 0.5ml to 15ml) with rubber sealing rings, organized according to the specific needs of different chemicals. For especially sensitive developers like Phenidone, the most critical storage component requiring meticulous attention, the text recommends dividing into micro-batches of 0.25-0.4g in CO₂-filled vials, with optimal storage in freezers (-18°C) extending shelf life to 3 years. Similar detailed guidelines are provided for other key reagents: Methylene Blue (stored in 3ml vials with minimal air exposure), EDTA (4g batches in 5ml vials), Hydroquinone (5g batches in 10ml amber vials), Metol (with special allergy warnings and 2g batches), and Sodium Ascorbate (1g batches in 5ml vials). The chapter includes a comprehensive inventory tracking system with unique numerical codes for each chemical, organized by functional groups (preservatives, buffers, developing agents, etc.), complete with availability status and pre-measured quantities for convenient use. An economic analysis compares various developers, with Ilford Microphen being the most cost-effective per film (0.35zł) and PQ-Nuar the most expensive per liter (6.23zł). This systematic approach transforms what could be a complex chemical storage challenge into a manageable, efficient process for the home darkroom photographer.

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: SOLUTION VERIFICATION AND PROCESSING CONTROLS

The fourth chapter addresses the critical aspects of verifying chemical solutions and processing methods in analog photography, establishing reliable quality control protocols. The cornerstone of the chapter is a systematic approach to developer verification through standardized tests with exposed film strips: timing how long it takes for film to reach uniform density provides a benchmark for calculating accurate development times. A comprehensive table presents reference darkening times, standard development times, and correction factors for different agitation methods across popular developers like F-MicroStable, Microphen, D-76, and F-23-F5aRx, with a clear working formula (Development time = Reference time × (Reference darkening / Measured darkening) × K-factor). Similarly, fixer verification employs the "clearing time" method, measuring how quickly the solution removes non-halogenized silver, with specific guidelines for interpreting results: less than 1 minute indicates a fresh solution, 1.5-2 minutes represents normal activity, 2.5-3 minutes signals declining activity requiring doubled fixing time, and beyond 3 minutes means replacement is necessary. The chapter details essential reagent preparation rules emphasizing filtered water, proper containers, precise recipe adherence, and careful handling to prevent cross-contamination. Special attention is given to dissolving Phenidone (342), which requires a specialized alcohol-based method due to its poor water solubility, with specific techniques for preparing 0.15g, 0.25g, and 0.4g measurements using ethanol. The chapter culminates with the Methylene Blue test for archival quality, a critical verification of negative permanence based on residual thiosulfate detection, with detailed procedures for both sample immersion and drop tests, and a classification system for archival standards ranging from "Museum standard" (>100 years) to "Insufficient washing" (<10 years). This comprehensive verification system ensures predictable, consistent results while maximizing the longevity of photographic materials.

# Chapter Summary: Photographic Recipes and Formulations

The fifth chapter presents a comprehensive collection of precise photographic chemical formulations, organized as a systematic cookbook with meticulous attention to component measurements, tolerances, and processing procedures. The chapter covers the complete film development workflow, beginning with sodium citrate pre-soaking baths (1.2g/L) that optimize film emulsions before development. Seven distinct developer formulations are presented, each with unique characteristics: classic Kodak D-76 for balanced contrast, Ilford Microphen for push processing, F-MicroStable for excellent midtone separation without metol, F-96 Stable for fine-grained negatives ideal for scanning, F-23-F5aRx for finely detailed images, HQ-OFORT for velvety shadows with distinctive grain structure, and PQ-Nuar for noir-style high-contrast images. The development process is complemented by a citric acid stop bath (15g/L) that halts development and prevents developer carryover into subsequent stages. Two fixer formulations are provided: A-300MS medium acidic fixer and A-300LMS light acidic fixer, both incorporating methylene blue indicator for monitoring silver saturation. The workflow concludes with a systematic two-stage washing protocol: an initial rinse to quickly remove fixer residue, followed by a final wash with EDTA and polysorbate 20 to ensure complete removal of heavy metal salts and enhance archival stability. Throughout the chapter, each formulation includes precise measurements with acceptable tolerances, temperature requirements, sequential mixing instructions, and practical notes on usage conditions and storage limitations. The chapter provides a methylene blue test protocol for verifying archival quality, categorizing results from "Museum standard" (>100 years) to "Insufficient washing" (<10 years). This complete processing system ensures predictable, consistent results while maximizing the longevity of photographic materials.
